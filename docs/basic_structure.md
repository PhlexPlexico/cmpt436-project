UI

### Homepage

The bulk of the screen is probably some kind of feed tailored to this user.

Left sidebar:
 * contacts: list of contacts added by this user. A zero-sum balance is maintained between the user and each contact. Contacts are real users who have their own account.
 * actors (name?): list of *non-user* entities added by this user. A zero-sum balance is maintained between the user and each actor. (A user can make up any actor they want, and has complete control over the balance.)
 * groups: list of payment groups this user is a part of. 

Clicking on the link to any particular contact, actor, or group takes the user to that particular Feed page.

### Feed page.

Feed pages are identical for contacts, actors and groups. They just consist of a feed of past interactions with this contact, actor, or group, as well as a list of balances for each actor/contact involved.

At least one admin user is assigned for each feed page. An admin can:
  * Approve a user/actor's departure or entry into the current group. This entails deciding how to change the group account balance after the departure/entry. 
  * Approve new transactions. For purchases, this entails deciding how to split the new cost among the group members. 
  * More to come.
